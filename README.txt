Brel Home Local allows you to control your blinds without being dependent on the cloud backend by Brel.

The Brel Home Local app connects directly to your Brel Home Hub on your local network instead of going through the Brel Home services.

Note that it is still required to pair your devices using the Brel Home App, but after pairing you can use this app and block outgoing traffic from your hub, or even delete your Brel Home account.
